//Storing friends names in an Array

//Excercise 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
//should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


let names: string[] = ["Hamid", "Zahid", "Umair", "Shakoor"]

//printing names
console.log("Hello firends how are you," + " " + names[0]);
console.log("Hello firends how are you," + " " + names[1]);
console.log("Hello firends how are you," + " " + names[2]);
console.log("Hello firends how are you," + " " + names[3]);
