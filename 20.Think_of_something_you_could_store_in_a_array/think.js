//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var list = ['English', 'Urdu', 'Arbic', 'Sindhi', 'Punjabi'];
console.log('List of Languages:');
for (var a = 0; a < list.length; a++) {
    console.log(list[a]);
}
